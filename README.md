## How we built it

We built ***Gemini Finance Oracle** using a combination of **Python, Streamlit, and Google Vertex AI**. The application integrates with various APIs to fetch real-time stock data and news articles. We used Vertex AI for generating natural language responses based on the data, and Streamlit to create an interactive and user-friendly web interface. Additionally, we employed pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for plotting charts, and yfinance for accessing financial data.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the major challenges we faced was ensuring the accuracy and relevance of the AI-generated responses. Training the model to understand and analyze complex financial data was a difficult task. We also encountered issues with integrating multiple APIs and handling the large volume of data efficiently. Ensuring the application remains responsive and user-friendly was another significant challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of successfully creating a comprehensive financial assistant that can provide real-time insights and answer user queries effectively. Integrating advanced AI models to generate accurate and useful financial advice is a significant achievement. Additionally, we are proud of the user-friendly interface we developed, which makes complex financial analysis accessible to everyone.

## What we learned

Throughout this project, we learned a lot about natural language processing, financial data analysis, and the intricacies of integrating various APIs. We also gained valuable experience in building scalable and responsive web applications using Streamlit. This project has deepened our understanding of AI and its applications in the financial domain.

## What's next for Gemini Finance Oracle

In the future, we plan to enhance Gemini Finance Oracle by incorporating more advanced AI models and expanding its data sources to include more diverse financial instruments. We aim to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis and provide more personalized insights based on user preferences.
